MSc
===

I have a Master Degree(MSc) in Computer Science at `Departamento de Ciência da Computação (DCC) <http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/>`_ 
in `Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) <https://www.ufmg.br/>`_.
During my MSc, I have worked with two interesting NP-Hard optimization problems. I studied, the Robust Shortest 
Path Problem (RSP) and the Tree Hub Location problem (THLP). The former relies on a Shortest Path problem where
uncertainities are considered over the arc costs. The latter is a network design problem where one looks to locate hubs in a 
tree backbone in order to reduce the routing total costs.

My advisor in MSc was an intelligent and brilliant person: `Thiago Ferreira <http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~tfn>`_. He helped me
to improve my skills in Operational Research. We also conversation about the life. Nowadays, Thiago beyond be an advisor is a special
friend too.
My co-advisor in MSC was: `Andréa Cynthia <http://losi.utt.fr/fr/_plugins/mypage/mypage/content/duhamela.html>`_. Nowadays, I work with she in my :ref:`phd`.

My thesis: **Exact algorithms to the robust shortest path problem and the tree hub location problem** 
is available(in portuguese) `here <http://www.bibliotecadigital.ufmg.br/dspace/bitstream/handle/1843/ESBF-A9UMM3/jo_ocarlosabreujunior.pdf>`_.
During the MSc, I have published the following articles:

* `An integer linear programming formulation and heuristics for the minmax relative regret robust shortest path problem 
  <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-014-0187-x>`_
* `O problema de localizacão de concentradores em árvores: um procedimento para acelerar um algoritmo baseado em decomposicão de Benders`
* `Estudo comparativo entre formulações para o problema de caminho mais curto robusto`
* `Une étude de modèles mathématiques pour le problème du plus court chemin robuste`
