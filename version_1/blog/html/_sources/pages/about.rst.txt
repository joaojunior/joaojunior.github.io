About
=====

I have many interests in Computer Science and Mathematics. In particular algorithms and data structure. Today, I work more
with Operational Research. Specifically, I work with exacts algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. To write those
algorithms I use Python and C++.
Currently, I work with data science. Here, I wrote crawler to specific platforms and automation of variable analysis. I use Python to
write all softwares and libraries here.
In software development I already build desktop and web applications. To write desktop applications I use Python and
wxPython. Similarly, to write web applications, I work with Python and Django.
