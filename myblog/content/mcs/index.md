I have a Master Degree in Computer Science (MCS) at [Departamento de Ciência da Computação (DCC)](http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/), [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG)](https://www.ufmg.br/).
During my MCS, I have worked with two interesting NP-Hard optimization problems. I studied, the Robust Shortest 
Path Problem (RSP) and the Tree Hub Location problem (THLP). The former relies on a Shortest Path problem where
uncertainties are considered over the arc costs. The latter is a network design problem where one looks to locate hubs in a 
tree backbone in order to reduce the routing total costs.

My advisor in my MCS was an intelligent and brilliant person: [Thiago Ferreira](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~tfn). He helped me
to improve my skills in Operational Research. We also conversation about the life. Nowadays, Thiago beyond be an advisor is a special
friend too.

My thesis: **Exact algorithms to the robust shortest path problem and the tree hub location problem** 
is available(in portuguese) [here](http://hdl.handle.net/1843/ESBF-A9UMM3).
During the MCS, I have published the following articles:

* [An integer linear programming formulation and heuristics for the minmax relative regret robust shortest path problem](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-014-0187-x)
* O problema de localizacão de concentradores em árvores: um procedimento para acelerar um algoritmo baseado em decomposicão de Benders
* Estudo comparativo entre formulações para o problema de caminho mais curto robusto
* Une étude de modèles mathématiques pour le problème du plus court chemin robuste
