I wrote a list of operational research resource which contains many name of books, events, groups, solvers and teachers.
I publish this list [here](https://github.com/joaojunior/awesome-operational_research). It is a github's repository and you can help to update :-)

I wrote it based on the list, wrote by [Avelino](https://medium.com/@avelino0), about resources for [go programming language](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go).
