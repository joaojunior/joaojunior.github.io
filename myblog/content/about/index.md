I'm from [Belo Horizonte - MG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte), Brazil and I already lived in United States, France, Malta and Canada.

I have been using computers since 1994 when my father gave me my first [486DX2 66MHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486) with 16MB of memory and a 2.1GB hard disk. On this computer, I started using [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) as an operating system. After I used Windows [Windows 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x), Windows 95, Windows 98, and many other Windows operation system. About 1999/2000 I knew [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) and I started to use it.

I started my career installing Windows operating system and solves problems in peopleâ€™s computers. After this, I worked as Network Admin and since 2004 I have been working with software development. I already used many different programming languages, such as [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming_language), [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

I love Computer Science and Mathematics. In particular algorithms and data structure.
