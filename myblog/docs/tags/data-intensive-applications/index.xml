      <description>Disclaimer: Don&amp;rsquo;t read this review, go ahead and read the book, it will be much better for you. The only reason that I wrote this is for my future reference.
First of all, I love to read books and I do not believe that a review should influence someone to read or not a book. However, as a researcher, one of the most important things that I learned during my years at the university was the importance to write a review of papers.</description>
