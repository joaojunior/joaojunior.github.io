selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: Chrome failed to start: crashed
It is caused because Chrome uses the /dev/shm to share memory and the docker, by default, set 64MB for this partition.
Here, I will describe how to reproduce this error and how to resolve it.
How to reproduce To reproduce this error, we need to create a docker image with chrome and python.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Paragraphs</title><link>https://joaojunior.org/posts/identify-paragraphs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 17:00:19 -0500</pubDate><author>blog@joaojunior.org (Joao Junior)</author><guid>https://joaojunior.org/posts/identify-paragraphs/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m learning computer vision and I&amp;rsquo;m using the Opencv and Python to write algorithms in this field of computer science. This field is very interesting because it involves computer science and math and also, it is necessary to have good ideas to solve problems.
Here, I will show my first algorithm in computer vision. It is to identifies paragraphs in a text image. It consider that the image have a white background and that the characters have a black color.</description></item><item><title>Resources in Operational Research</title><link>https://joaojunior.org/posts/my-second-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2017 09:42:04 -0400</pubDate><author>blog@joaojunior.org (Joao Junior)</author><guid>https://joaojunior.org/posts/my-second-post/</guid><description>I wrote a list of operational research resource which contains many name of books, events, groups, solvers and teachers. I publish this list here. It is a github&amp;rsquo;s repository and you can help to update :-)
I wrote it based on the list, wrote by Avelino, about resources for go programming language.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://joaojunior.org/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blog@joaojunior.org (Joao Junior)</author><guid>https://joaojunior.org/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m from Belo Horizonte - MG, Brazil and I already lived in United States, France, Malta and Canada.
I have been using computers since 1994 when my father gave me my first 486DX2 66MHz with 16MB of memory and a 2.1GB hard disk. On this computer, I started using MS-DOS as an operating system. After I used Windows Windows 3.11, Windows 95, Windows 98, and many other Windows operation system. About 1999/2000 I knew GNU/Linux and I started to use it.</description></item><item><title>MCS</title><link>https://joaojunior.org/mcs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>blog@joaojunior.org (Joao Junior)</author><guid>https://joaojunior.org/mcs/</guid><description>I have a Master Degree in Computer Science (MCS) at Departamento de Ciência da Computação (DCC), Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG). During my MCS, I have worked with two interesting NP-Hard optimization problems. I studied, the Robust Shortest Path Problem (RSP) and the Tree Hub Location problem (THLP). The former relies on a Shortest Path problem where uncertainties are considered over the arc costs. The latter is a network design problem where one looks to locate hubs in a tree backbone in order to reduce the routing total costs.</description></item></channel></rss>
