      <description>Disclaimer: Don&amp;rsquo;t read this review, go ahead and read the book, it will be much better for you. The only reason that I wrote this is for my future reference.
First of all, I love to read books and I do not believe that a review should influence someone to read or not a book. However, as a researcher, one of the most important things that I learned during my years at the university was the importance to write a review of papers.</description>

      <title>Chrome with selenium, python and docker</title>

      <description>Sometimes, when I execute the Chrome inside a docker container I receive the error below:
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: Chrome failed to start: crashed
It is caused because Chrome uses the /dev/shm to share memory and the docker, by default, set 64MB for this partition.
Here, I will describe how to reproduce this error and how to resolve it.
How to reproduce To reproduce this error, we need to create a docker image with chrome and python.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m learning computer vision and I&amp;rsquo;m using the Opencv and Python to write algorithms in this field of computer science. This field is very interesting because it involves computer science and math and also, it is necessary to have good ideas to solve problems.
Here, I will show my first algorithm in computer vision. It is to identifies paragraphs in a text image. It consider that the image have a white background and that the characters have a black color.</description>

      <description>I wrote a list of operational research resource which contains many name of books, events, groups, solvers and teachers. I publish this list here. It is a github&amp;rsquo;s repository and you can help to update :-)
I wrote it based on the list, wrote by Avelino, about resources for go programming language.</description>

      <title>Callbacks in Cplex</title>

      <description>Callbacks in Cplex I used LazyConstraintCallback to implement a Branch and Cut algorithm with CPLEX, but when I implemented and run this algorithm, it was very slow if I compare it with its version that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use callbacks in Cplex. The reason is because ControlCallback(LazyConstraintCallback is a ControlCallback) switch Cplex to sequential mode by default and turn off dynamic search. I wrote this post, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t find this information in Cplex’s documentation, I only found it in this technical forum.</description>
