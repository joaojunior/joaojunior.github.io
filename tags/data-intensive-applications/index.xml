      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Don&amp;rsquo;t read this review, go ahead and read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataintensive.net/&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, it will be much better for you. The only reason that I wrote this is for my future reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I love to read books and I do not believe that a review should influence someone to read or not a book. However, as a researcher, one of the most important things that I learned during my years at the university was the importance to write a review of papers. After reading a paper, we should write a review. Not to publish, but to describe in our words what we read and also to future references. So, do not expect here a complete resume of the book or the concepts present in it. Also, do not think that this is a replacement or a complement of the book, it is not. This book is fantastic and you should read it if you like this subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
