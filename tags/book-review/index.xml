      <description>First things first, this is a classic book by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister that everyone working in the software industry must read.&#xA;The third edition divides this book into 6 parts with 39 chapters and 249 pages. It is an easy book to read and follow. However, it is necessary to stop constantly to reflect on the facts and ideas presented. Also, the reading would be like a map of the industry if you had a lot of experience in the software development industry.</description>

However, as a researcher, one of the most important things that I learned during my years at the university was the importance to write a review of papers.</description>
