Resources in Operational Research
=================================

I write a list of operational research resource. In this list have many name of books, events, groups, solvers and teachers.
I publish this list here: `awesome-operational_research <https://github.com/joaojunior/awesome-operational_research>`_.
It is a github's repository and you can help to update :-)

I write based on the list, wrote by `Avelino <https://medium.com/@avelino0>`_, about resources for `go programming language <https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go>`_.

You can also read this in `Medium. <https://medium.com/@joaojunior.ma/callbacks-in-cplex-7e459571b007#.as9fz74xv>`_
